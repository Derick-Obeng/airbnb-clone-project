## üìú Feature Breakdown
-User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
-Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval by the admin.
-Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details for users.
-Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details for retrival.
-Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties to help admins upgrade.
-Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## üîê API Security
-Authentication: Verifies that users are who they say they are (e.g., logging in with credentials,
Prevents unauthorized access to personal dashboards, bookings, and payment info.
-Authorization: Determines what authenticated users are allowed to do.
Ensures access is role-based and limits misuse of privileges.
-Rate Limiting: Restricts how often users can make requests (e.g., to login or search).
Defends against abuse like brute-force attacks and spamming.
-Input Validation & Sanitization: Filters and validates incoming data to prevent malicious input.
Stops attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
Data Encryption (at rest and in transit): Secures sensitive data (e.g., user passwords and payment info).
Protects user privacy and complies with data protection regulations.

## ü™à CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD pipelines refer to Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment workflows that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. This ensures that updates to your backend (built with tools like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL) are reliable, efficient, and consistently delivered.

#### why it matters to this project 
-Efficiency: Code changes are automatically tested and deployed, reducing manual work.
-Reliability: Errors are caught early, ensuring a stable booking platform.
-Speed: Features reach users faster, keeping development agile.
-Team Collaboration: Supports smooth workflows when multiple developers are pushing changes.

#### tools that could be used 
GitHub Actions ‚Äì For automating testing and deployment directly from your GitHub repo.
Docker ‚Äì For containerizing your app to ensure consistent environments across development and production.
Other options ‚Äì Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI if you want more customization.
